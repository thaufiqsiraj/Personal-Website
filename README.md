# Personal-Website
https://personal-website.vu22csen0600178.repl.co/
I have made a new website with pure HTML and CSS with no JS. I took up this challenge and this was pure fun. Pedro Duarte inspired me to make my own personal website. 
# The goal
The goal was to make it completely uninteractive to the user, yet give off a lot of beautiful elements and information. It has to be short and simple and also good looking.
# The Process 
- Firstly, I designed it in Figma which did take a lot of time starting from scratch. The design went back and forth with multiple types. 
-  Finally, Apple Music color pallette seemed to be the perfect go. It is a beauty in in itself.
- Then I chose to use Replit. It is very comfortable to use for machines like mine where downloading external software is a Nightmare!
- If you are wondering, I use Asus C202SA (base model). So it is evident that it is not just difficult but sometimes straight up impossible to make good webites. Yet, here we are.

Your contributions are always welcome. Thank you.
